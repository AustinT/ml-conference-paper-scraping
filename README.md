# ML Conference paper scraping

Some Jupyter notebooks I used to scrape papers, and find authors with certain
expertise to serve as reviewers for a workshop.

**Disclaimer**: do not use this for inappropriate scraping, or to spam people.

To run, just install standard python packages, plus `openreview-py`.

One notebook downloads all titles/abstracts and saves them in a standard
format, and another does some basic searching from this data.
